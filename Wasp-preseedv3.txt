# installations on non-networked devices where the network questions,
# warning and long timeouts are a nuisance.
#d-i netcfg/enable boolean false

# netcfg will choose an interface that has link if possible. This makes it
# skip displaying a list if there is more than one interface.

# it, this might be useful.

# from being shown, even if values come from dhcp.

#### Advanced options
### Running custom commands during the installation
# d-i preseeding is inherently not secure. Nothing in the installer checks
# for attempts at buffer overflows or other exploits of the values of a
# preconfiguration file like this one. Only use preconfiguration files from
# trusted locations! To drive that home, and because it's generally useful,
# here's a way to run any shell command you'd like inside the installer,
# automatically.

# This first command is run as early as possible, just after
# preseeding is read.
#d-i preseed/early_command string anna-install some-udeb
# This command is run immediately before the partitioner starts. It may be
# useful to apply dynamic partitioner preseeding that depends on the state
# of the disks (which may not be visible when preseed/early_command runs).
#d-i partman/early_command \
#       string debconf-set partman-auto/disk "$(list-devices disk | head -n1)"
# This command is run just before the install finishes, but when there is
# still a usable /target directory. You can chroot to /target and use it
# directly, or use the apt-install and in-target commands to easily install
# packages and run commands in the target system.
d-i preseed/late_command string \
#in-target curl -fsSL https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | gpg --dearmor | tee /target/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/elasticsearch.gpg > /dev/null \
in-target echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" >> /target/etc/apt/sources.list.d/elasticsearch.list; \
in-target apt-get update; \
#apt-get install filebeat;
